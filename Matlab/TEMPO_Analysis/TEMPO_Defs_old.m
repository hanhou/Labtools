%-- TEMPO_Defs.m: This file contains a bunch of definitions that are needed to interpret and work with
%--	data from TEMPO.  Some of the indices here MUST match up with their respective indices in the TEMPO
%--	protocol.  I have tried to put all such TEMPO-specific defines in this module, and urge you to 
%--	maintain this structure.   GCD, 1/3/2000
